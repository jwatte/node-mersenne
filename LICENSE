This code is an adaptation of the Mersenne Twister implementation 
by Makoto Matsumoto and Tajuji Nishimura, previously adapted by 
Yasuharu Okada.

I place the adaptation in the public domain; I disclaim any and all 
exclusive, special, or incidental rights to it, and you can do with 
it as you want. I also disclaim any liability, and do not warrant 
the code for any usage.

If your country or legal department does not allow disclaiming all 
liability for public domain sources, you may not accept usage of 
this code.
